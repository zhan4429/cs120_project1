            <strong>Ashley</strong> has been classically trained upon the violin
            in the Suzuki Method at Indiana University beginning at the age of
            four years old and has performed with various orchestras throughout
            the Midwest. Her college years were spent in Northern Indiana
            attending Saint Mary’s College, Notre Dame where she was a member of
            the Notre Dame rowing team. After graduating Law School and
            relocating to Carmel, Indiana to practice law, she became active on
            the Board of Directors for the Center for the Performing Arts at the
            Palladium in Carmel, Indiana. In 2020, while spending time with
            friends, Ashley decided to apply her talents to the electric violin
            in order to play rock and country music, and Six Figures was born!

            <strong>Chris</strong> is from Carmel, IN but currently resides in
            Indianapolis. He has spent years living in places all over the
            country like Seattle, Port Townsend, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kinnic
            Falls, and Bloomington, Indiana. He also works in real estate as
            well as volunteers for addiction issues all over the state. He first
            learned the piano at around 5 years old and didn’t even pick up a
            guitar until around high school. Though the ground work to be able
            to utilize the music theory was learned at a young age, it wasn’t
            until roughly 2016 that he put those skills to good use. Since then
            he Chris has played at local fundraisers, gigs and festivals around
            the Indy area including opening for Jenny Devoe.

            <strong>Kevin</strong> is a singer songwriter from Indianapolis. His
            love for music came early and developed in school as a drummer in
            the marching band in junior high and high school. 6 state
            championships and a trip to New York to March in the Macys
            thanksgiving day parade are part of his experience. Though he never
            quit playing the drums, singing became his strength in music and led
            to writing and recording later in life. He has shared a stage with
            Sammy Hagar who played guitar for Kevin’s original song called
            Diamond Eyes. He recorded songs with Henry Lee Summer and is
            currently working on many more songs. Kevin sings lead vocals for
            Six Figures and is currently working on some new originals with the
            band.

            <strong>Martin</strong> started playing guitar in high school but
            took a long 20 year pause in music. Then he moved back to Indiana
            and was convinced by his brother Bart to pick up a bass and join Six
            Figures. This was 2 years ago and now Martin is the full time bass
            player in Six Figures Band.
